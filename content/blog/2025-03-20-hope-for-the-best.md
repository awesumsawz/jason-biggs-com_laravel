Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

Almost exactly one year ago, after nearly five years at my previous employer, I received a calendar invite at 10 PM that included my boss's boss and an HR representative. Less than 12 hours later, for the first time in my life, I found myself unemployed.

I wasn't ready. I'd counted on the quality of my internal work to speak for itself, neglecting external projects that showcased my skills to potential employers. Entering today's competitive job market without a strong, up-to-date portfolio turned out to be a costly mistake.

Here's some straightforward advice for anyone currently employed who wants to be ready if (or when) that unexpected meeting invite appears:

• Consistently Build Your Portfolio: Even if your schedule is packed, dedicate time regularly to showcasing your best work. Side projects aren't just fun--they could become your career lifeline.

• Track Your Metrics: Retention, clicks, engagement rates--numbers tell compelling stories that resonate deeply with hiring managers and recruiters, beyond just visuals.

• Keep Learning: Industries evolve rapidly. Staying sharp by exploring new tools, platforms, and skills can keep you marketable and competitive.

Don't make the mistake I did. Act now to ensure you're prepared for your next opportunity--whether you're anticipating change or feeling secure.

What strategies have you used to keep your skills fresh and your portfolio ready for the employment hunt?
