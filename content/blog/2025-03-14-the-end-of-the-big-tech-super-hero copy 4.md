The best advice I got as a junior developer? Never paste anything into your project unless you understand exactly what it does. Not only does this protect you from vulnerabilities, it also ensures you grow.

The same thing goes for AI. If youâ€™re learning, avoid yolo mode at all costs. Make sure you know what the AI is doing at each step. 

Pro tip: Include in your prompts that the AI only move onto the next step when you allow it to do so. Then you can ask clarifying questions and seek additional information without missing anything!
